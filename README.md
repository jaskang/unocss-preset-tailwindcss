# unocss-preset-tailwindcss

A unocss preset that aligns with the official features of Tailwind, emphasizing consistency.

The goal is to seamlessly switch projects using Tailwind to unocss-preset-tailwindcss.

# Why

Tailwind encompasses a set of highly standardized design specifications that I can't live without after using it. However, it lacks speed and feels a bit cumbersome.

Unocss, on the other hand, is fast and integrates better with the frontend toolchain. However, the official `preset-wind` doesn't strictly adhere to Tailwind's rules; it's a mishmash that feels quite loose.

I want developers to be able to focus on Tailwind's official documentation while enjoying the advantages of unocss.
